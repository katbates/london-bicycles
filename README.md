# london-bicycles project in SQL
## Overview
This project uses the london_bicycles public dataset on BigQuery. I run SQL queries to gather insights from the dataset about bike useage in London. 

The questions I asked of the data were:
1. What is the most popular cycle station?
2. What are the characteristics of the most popular journeys?
3. How does bike useage change over time?
4. How much time are bikes spent unused?
   
## Dataset
The london_bicycles public dataset on BigQuery contains two tables (cycle_hires and stations) and has data for all rides between 2015 and 2022. 

## Project use
* Copy the SQL queries into BigQuery to run them
* Download the csv files for output of queries (except 'date query' as csv is too large to upload)

## Acknowledgements
BigQuery for providing the london_bicycles public dataset.
